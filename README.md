# Ethanol-or-Gasoline
App to help people choose between fueling their cars with Ethanol or Gasoline.

It's not because de Ethanol is cheaper than Gasoline, that you should go with Ethanol.<br/>
So, to help you to know wich one is really cheaper, I create the "Ethanol or Gasoline" app to help.

The use of the app is really simple:

Step One: The user inform the price of Ethanol and Gasoline.<br/>
Step Two: Push the button "Check".<br/>
Step Three: The app will do the math and show the cheaper to fuel.
