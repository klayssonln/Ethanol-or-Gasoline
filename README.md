# Ethanol-or-Gasoline
App to help people choose between fueling their cars with Ethanol or Gasoline.

It's not because de Ethanol is cheaper than Gasoline, that you should go with Ethanol.
So, to help you to know wich one is really cheaper, I create the "Ethanol or Gasoline" app to help.

The use of the app is really simple:

Step One: The user inform the price of Ethanol and Gasoline.
Step Two: Push the button "Check".
Step Three: The app will do the math and show the cheaper to fuel.
